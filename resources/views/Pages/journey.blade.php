                            When I first decided to apply to the IT program offered at Nova Scotia Community College I
                            knew nothing more about programming or computers than I wanted to work with them as a career.
                            I had dabbled in programming here and there over the years, but could never fully grasp or
                            internalize what I learned. In the first semester I found the classes general enough that I
                            wasn't overwhelmed with any of the subjects and was able to decide what I really enjoyed working
                            with in the IT industry. I was able to figure out that I had a passion for programming software,
                            so I chose to do the application development stream. In my second semester we went more in
                            depth with programming concepts, and also were introduced to SQL and dealing with databases.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The more in depth into programming we got, the more the instructors introduced the concept of
                            how to look for specific information regarding any issues we may be having with the code. This
                            was probably the single most helpful skill I learned while taking this program. The instructors
                            were very focused on teaching us how to use and read the debugger for whatever IDE we may be
                            using. This was a big change for me personally, as I was used to debugging by exclusively
                            writing console messages and waiting to see if I saw it before something crashed. In pretty
                            much every case that it is available, the debugger provides <strong>many</strong> helpful
                            functions outside of reporting the result of an error or crash.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In terms of finding a job, I would say that the best thing Nova Scotia Community College has
                            done for me, aside from the hard skills and hands on experience with specific languages and
                            platforms, would be the extra confidence in my abilities. I still feel like I don't know a lot
                            about programming, but I now feel like I know enough to start and like I have the ability to
                            research and self-teach myself whatever I need to know.

                        <p>
                            I am currently graduating from Nova Scotia Community College with a degree in Database
                            Application Development. This program has given me hands on experience with various
                            programming languages including Python, C#, Java, SQL, and PHP. Along side the instruction
                            in languages I received experience and instruction in the software development lifecycle,
                            project management, and various documentation methods.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Through the work term requirements in the program I was lucky enough to land a position
                            with a small company that will lead into a permanent, salaried, position. By working in the
                            industry part-time while in school I was able to get experience working in an Agile environment
                            and dealing more heavily with source control than was taught in school.

                            Currently I don't have much of a long term plan as I have just completed my only major goal
                            that I have made in the past few years, which was to graduate the IT program and get a job
                            as a software developer. I have vague ideas of what I might like to do in the world of IT,
                            but nothing concrete just yet. My short term plan is to save up money to get more stable
                            financially. It's difficult to pick a direction to try to take my career at this point because
                            I haven't been working in the industry for very long so I still don't know what aspects of
                            IT and software development I will enjoy or hate.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first main idea of what I would like to do in the future is that I would like
                            to learn Swift so I could program on iOS devices. I get ideas for apps I would like to
                            create for personal use exactly to the specifications I need/want.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The second main idea for where I would like to go with my career would be to make games. I've
                            always loved games and have always been interested in creating my own. I get small ideas for
                            parts of games frequently but don't have the experience (or time currently) to try and
                            implement any of it.

                    <div class="panel-heading"><h4>How will I get there ?</h4></div>
                    <div class="panel-body">
                        <p>
                            My plan for getting to where I want to be in my career is to continue learning as long as I'm
                            working. The technologies are constantly changing and without keeping up to date with the
                            newest versions of software, or the newest methods for doing things, will guarantee that my
                            career will stagnate and I'll never get to where I want to be.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Speaking specifically to the vague goals I mentioned, regarding learning Swift for iOS
                            development I have been reading some e-books centered around Swift and iOS development. I
                            have also been looking at some online resources to see how other handle dealing with certain
                            issues in Swift. To get myself closer to developing games I have been working with Unity a
                            little bit. Watching tutorial videos and coding along, creating small games from the code
                            snippets I see used to help me understand how the code functions.
